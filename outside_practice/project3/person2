1457737220 9 Are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
1457737240 6 Oh!, Well, is that the witch?
1457737260 45 Well, I'm a little muddled. The Munchkins called me because a new witch has just dropped a house on the Wicked Witch of the East. And there's the house, and here you are, and that's all that's left of the Wicked Witch of the East.
1457737265 16 And so the Munchkins want to know are you a good witch, or a bad witch?
1457737280 16 The Munchkins. They're laughing because I am a witch. I'm Glinda, the Witch of the North.
1457737300 5 Only bad witches are ugly.

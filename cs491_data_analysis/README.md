# Programming Assignment 3

Run the program by calling:
 
 python dta.py

 on the command line.

 After this there will be 2 different arff files generated -> 

 trained.arff and evaled.arff

 They each coinside with train.txt and eval.txt respectively

 I played around with the weka with the weather data that you gave before and go it working with that, but it wouldn't work with the data I generated. I found other students used a different library within python to make it work, but I just couldn't figure it out.

 Between trying to set up this darn environment of installing pretty much every library on this planet for the past week I wish I heard about their library suggestion sooner.

 naive Bayes classifiers are a family of simple probablistic classiffiers based on apply Bayes' theorem with a strong naive independence assumptions between the features.

 Logistic regression models the probability of the default class

 Bayes vs Logistic regression differ in 5 ways:

 Purpose, Learning mechanism, model assumptions, model limitations, and approach to be followed to improve the results.

Thank you for this lesson!
